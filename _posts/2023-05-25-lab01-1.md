## 1. Upload the files to http://www.VirusTotal.com/ and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures? 
 
  - **lab01-01.exe**: has a 54/71 detection rate
  - **lab01-01.dll**: has a 45/71 detection rate



## 2. When were these files compiled?
 using pestido.exe I can see compiler-stamp for 
 - lab01-01.exe: Sun Dec 19 16:16:19 2010
 - lab01-01.dll: Sun Dec 19 16:16:38 2010


## 3. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators?
 the file has an entropy = 1.954, and I didn't see any function or imports tell me it's packed.
 Using PEview we can see the virtual size is close to the raw size of the files.

## 4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?
 After analysis of Lab01-10.exe I got some interesting functions imported from KERNEL32.DLL, these were:
  
  - CopyFile
  - FindFirstFile
  - FindNextFile

 Based on that I guess the malware author wants to search for the file system and copy it.   


## 5. Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?
 here we can see the file "C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll" is close to kernel32.dll he uses '1' instead of 'l' it is likely malicious.

## 6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware onvinfected machines?
 by analyzing strings in lab01-01.dll I found that IP address can be a network-based indicator `127.26.152.13`.

## 7. What would you guess is the purpose of these files?
 I guess that the executable is used to run the DLL which acts as a backdoor. Based on the imports it’s possible the executable searches to see if C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll exists, and if it doesn’t it may attempt to copy the malicious DLL to C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll, it likely contacts a C2 server at 
 `127.26.152.13`.
