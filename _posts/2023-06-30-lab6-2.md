## 2.What is the subroutine located at 0x40117F?

I found the `sub_401282` function that contains a switch cases code.

and if we note there are a `__stbuf` and `__ftbuf` functions that are functions in C++ that are used to control buffering of input/output operations on streams__stbuf is used to enable buffering on a stream while `__ftbuf` is used to disable buffering on a stream1.


## 3.What does the second subroutine called by main do?

checks user agent is `Internet Explorer 7.5/pma` and call `InternetOpenA` ,`InternetOpenUrlA` and `InternetReadFile` to open `http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com` url and read data from it.

## 4.What type of code construct is used in this subroutine?

there are a lot of If\Then conditional statement ,if we look under `internetReadFile` we can see multiple compare statements based on 4 characters from the buffer,`<!--` that used in HTML code.
