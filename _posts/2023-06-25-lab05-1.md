## 1. What is the address of DllMain?

  we can found the function address by open **options > General > Line Prefixes**, and we get the adress function DllMain `100151B8`


## 2. Use the Imports window to browse to gethostbyname. Where is the import located?

By viewing imports,search about gethostbyname and we found the import located is `100163CC`

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/imports.png)


## 3. How many functions call gethostbyname?

by going to the gethostbyname and clicking right on the mouse and going to `jump to xref to operand ` or just click **X** 
![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/call_func.png)

we found some functions call it but as we see It is called nine times...
![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/xrefs.png)

**"Some versions of IDA Pro double-count cross-references: p is a reference because it is being called, and r is a reference because it is a "read" reference (since it is called dword ptr [...] for an import, the CPU must read the import and then call into it)."**


## 4. Focusing on the call to gethostbyname located at 0x10001757, can you figure out which DNS request will be made?

By using the jump to address function or clicking **G** we can jump to address `0x10001757` and then go to `off_10019040` that contains the DNS request.

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/off_dns.png)

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/dns_request.png)


## 5. How many local variables have IDA Pro recognized for the subroutine at 0x10001656?

after jumping to address `0x10001656` we found 23 variable ida can be recognized.
![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/var.png)


## 6. How many parameters has IDA Pro recognized for the subroutine at 0x10001656?
by looking at the last screenshot we found one parameter ida can recognize `lpThreadParameter`.


## 7. Use the Strings window to locate the string \cmd.exe /c in the disassembly. Where is it located?

by going to **search > text** or **ALT+T** we can search through the strings window for cmd.exe, and we can find where it is located `.text:100101D0`

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/search_text.png)

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/text.png)


## 8.What is happening in the area of code that references \cmd.exe /c?

By following the xref to the subroutine which references \cmd.exe /c:

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/cmd.png)

there are many interesting values being pushed to the stack:

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/quit.png)

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/exit.png)

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/cd.png)

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/inject.png)

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/minstall.png)

we can find that the char array aHiMasterDDDDDD mentioning a ‘Remote Shell Session’

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/shell.png)


## 9. In the same area, at 0x100101C8, it looks like dword_1008E5C4 is a global variable that helps decide which path to take. How does the malware set dword_1008E5C4? (Hint: Use dword_1008E5C4’s cross-references.)

by using dword_1008E5C4’s cross-references I found three locations that write in one:
![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/crf_ref.png)

After that call function `sub_100036C3` that checks the OS version by using `GetVersionExA` to decide which function to go into.
![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/get_version.png)
![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/cmp.png)

## 10. A few hundred lines into the subroutine at 0x1000FF58, a series of comparisons uses memcmp to compare strings. What happens if the string comparison to robotwork is successful (when memcmp returns 0)?

by looking into sub_1000FF58+4E0↑j in loc_10010444 location I find an entry comparing `robotwork` which uses the JNZ branch
![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/robot_work.png)
it returns zero so that call `sub_100052A2` that  tries to open registry key `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion` 
![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/regKey.png)
If successful, reads a registry key WorkTimes," which is a string represented integer.
![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/worktime.png)
sub_100052A2 returns the constructed string, Execution continues until `sub_100038EE` is called, which sends the finished string through the socket


## 11. What does the export PSLIST do?

In the first, it gets an os version:

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/gt_ver.png)

After that it jump to `.text:10007046` because the return value is zero and after that call function `sub_10006518` 

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/condtion.png)

that function call CreateToolhelp32Snapshot that Takes a snapshot of the specified processes, as well as the heaps, modules, and threads used by these processes
then Sends the name of the process and PID over the socket.

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/pid.png)

after that call `OpenProcess` and `EnumProcessModules` that Retrieve a handle for each module in the specified process.

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/open_proc.png)

Sends PID, exe path, and thread count over the socket.

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/send_path.png)

Writes process information to file `xinstall.dll`

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/write.png)


## 12. Use the graph mode to graph the cross-references from sub_10004E79. Which API functions could be called by entering this function? Based on the API functions alone, what could you rename this function?

By using G to go to the address of interest (in this case **sub_10004E79**), we can then click `View > Graphs > XRefs From` to see several API functions within this function.

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/graph.png)


## 13. How many Windows API functions does DllMain call directly? How many at a depth of 2?

By clicking `View > Graphs > User xrefs chart`, and then adjusting the settings to start and end at the function DLLMain with a depth of 2, we’re able to see 8 Windows API Functions.

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/grph.png)


## 14. At 0x10001358, there is a call to Sleep (an API function that takes one parameter containing the number of milliseconds to sleep). Looking backward through the code, how long will the program sleep if this code executes?

we can see that EAX is multiplied by 1000 before being pushed to the stack and called. This matches the reference to milliseconds, in that there are 1000 milliseconds in a second, Based on the call to atoi this is then converted to a number before being multiplied by 1000, and as such the program will sleep for 30 seconds if this executes.
![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/sleep.png)

## 15. At 0x10001701 is a call to socket. What are the three parameters?

socket function has three parameters `af`, `type`, `protocol`(2,1,6)

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/socket.png)


## 16. Using the MSDN page for socket and the named symbolic constants functionality in IDA Pro, can you make the parameters more meaningful? What are the parameters after you apply changes?

By looking into the MSDN Socket Function we can find what these numbers correlate to.
![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/msdn1.png)
![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/msdn2.png)

By right-clicking and selecting `Symbolic Constant > Use Standard Symbolic Constant` we’re able to quickly change these to accurately reflect their assigned values.

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/symbol.png)

## 17. Search for the usage of the in-instruction (opcode 0xED). This instruction is used with a magic string VMXh to perform VMware detection. Is that in use in this malware? Using the cross-references to the function that executes the in-instruction, is there further evidence of VMware detection?

By searching for ‘ED’ as a sequence of bytes (ALT+B) we can find only one occurrence of the instruction ‘in’.

yes, the in-instruction is present at `100061DB` with `VX` and `VMXh` strings.

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/in.png)

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/vm.png)

VPCEXT instruction is (anti–virtual machine trick) used to detect the presence of a Virtual PC, and if instruction runs on a virtual machine will return 0 on (EBX) register, (if ebx == 0) --> this means that Virtual PC detected,

If opcode 0F 3F b1 b2 is run outside Virtual PC, an illegal instruction exception is thrown otherwise return value in ebx register is checked. If the value in ebx register is 0 it means Virtual PC detected.

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/VPCEXT.png)


## 18. Jump your cursor to 0x1001D988. What do you find?

Probably an encoded string:

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic5_1/encoded_str.png)


## 19. If you have the IDA Python plug-in installed (included with the commercial version of IDA Pro), run Lab05-01.py, an IDA Pro Python script provided with the malware for this book. (Make sure the cursor is at 0x1001D988.) What happens after you run the script?

`Alt-F7`, ran the script. Decoded the string:`xdoor is this backdoor, string decoded for Practical Malware Analysis Lab :)1234`


## 20. With the cursor in the same location, how do you turn this data into a single ASCII string?

`A` to decode as an ASCII string.

## 21. Open the script with a text editor. How does it work?

XOR encoding with a value of 0x55,

   - Starting at the cursor location, loop for 0x50 bytes (80)
   - Grab the byte.
   - Perform bitwise XOR: b ^ 0x55 (85)
   - Patch the resulting byte back.

```
sea = ScreenEA()


for i in range(0x00,0x50):
    b = Byte(sea+i)
    decoded_byte = b ^ 0x55
    PatchByte(sea+i,decoded_byte)
```
