## 1. What do you notice when monitoring this malware with Process Explorer?
I notice `lab03-03.exe` create a console window host and host process for Windows service that calls `conhost.exe` and `svchost.exe` and then terminates itself from the device after creating a new host process that still running in the device:

## 2. Can you identify any live memory modifications?
Looking at svchost's properties in Process Explorer allows you to see that malware creates a file called `practicalmaleareanalysis.log`, `[BACKSPACE]`, and`[CAPS LOCK]`, suggestive of a keylogger from these strings.

## 3. What are the malwareâ€™s host-based indicators?
We can see both in memory and on disk that the malware creates a file called 'practicalmalwareanalysis.log' containing strings that match those found in the malicious svchost.exe.


## 4. What is the purpose of this program?
From all of this, the malware used as a keylogger gets elevated privileges via process replacement of svchost.exe, Guessing that it uses hooking to capture keystrokes.
