## 1. What is the major code construct found in the only subroutine called by main?

In the first, we can see the main function called the `sub_401000` function.

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_6/main_func.png)

after that `sub_401000` calls `InternetGetConnectedState` which has a condition that returns zero that which means the function is not connected to the internet and if returns one that is mean the connection is successful. (if statment)

## 2. What is the subroutine located at 0x40105F?

I found the `sub_401282` function that contains a switch cases code.

and if we note there are a `__stbuf` and `__ftbuf` functions that are functions in C++ that are used to control buffering of input/output operations on streams__stbuf is used to enable buffering on a stream while `__ftbuf` is used to disable buffering on a stream1.

## 3. What is the purpose of this program?

 - checks internet connection 
 - open file Hundle 
 - write characters to a file
