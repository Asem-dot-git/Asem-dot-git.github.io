## 1.What happens when you run this file?

The program did nothing,by using `procmon` I can see the malware do alot of events and in the end it create a process that can delete itself: 


![error](assets/images/malware-analysis/pic3-4/procmon)

## 2.What is causing the roadblock in dynamic analysis?
The program deletes itself from the hard drive, I think this is a one of a anti-debugging technique that realise the malware in a virtual machiene


## 3.Are there other ways to run this program?
 In a debugger like ida.
