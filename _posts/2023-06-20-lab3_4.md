## 1. What happens when you run this file?

The program did nothing, by using `procmon` I can see the malware do a lot of events and in the end, it creates a process that can delete itself: 


![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic3_4/procmon.png)

## 2. What is causing the roadblock in dynamic analysis?
The program deletes itself from the hard drive, I think this is one of the anti-debugging techniques that realize the malware in a virtual machine


## 3. Are there other ways to run this program?
 In a debugger like ida.
