## 1.Upload the Lab01-03.exe file to http://www.VirusTotal.com/. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions? 
  **there are 60/71 detection rates**.

## 2. Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.

 By using DIE.EXE we found 'section(1)' packed with high entropy = 7.36407,

 if we look at Dependency Walker we see kernel.dll that calls functions that are a good indicator to tell us it's packed:

 And by using PIED.EXE we can find the technique that was used to pack the file 'FSG technique'.

**To unpack it follow me step by step:**
we unpacked it by using **ollydpg**.

Let's try to find the OEP with `options` > `debugging options` > `SFX` > `Stop at entry of self-extractor`: after running the program the entry point is `00401090`. 

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_3/ollydebug.png)

It seems to be the beginning of a function, which confirms that we are likely to have found the OEP. Let's dump the process (`Plugins` > `OllyDumpEX` > `Dump process`):

Accept the default values and click on the Dump button. We're done.

## 3. Do any imports hint at this programâ€™s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you?
 
The only visible imports are used for unpacking.

KERNEL32.DLL

 - LoadLibraryA
 - GetProcAddress

## 4. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?

 After unpacking i founded some strings and URL that can a good indecator could identify this malware on infected machines:

  - http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com/ad.html
  - LoadLibrary
  - GetProcAddress
  - !Windows Program
  - OLEAUT32.dll
