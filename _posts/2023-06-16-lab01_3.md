## 1.Upload the Lab01-03.exe file to http://www.VirusTotal.com/. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions? 
 **there are 60/71 detection rates**.


## 2. Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.

 By using DIE.EXE we found 'section(1)' packed with high entropy = 7.36407,
 ![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_3/die.png)
 if we look at Dependency Walker we see kernel.dll that calls functions that are a good indicator to tell us it's packed:

 And by using PIED.EXE we can find the technique that was used to packed the file 'FSG technique'.

![error](/assets/images/malware-analysis/pic_3/fsg_packing.png)

we can unpacked it by using `unipacker` tool

## 3. Do any imports hint at this program’s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you?
 
The only visible imports are used for unpacking.

KERNEL32.DLL

 - LoadLibraryA
 - GetProcAddress

## 4. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?

 Can't find anything useful.
 Strings analysis shows OLE related contents.

OLEAUT32.DLL is for OLE technologies. Can't get much more than that without going deeper.
